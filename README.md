Snake Game in Python with Turtle Graphics


This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Python and the Turtle graphics library. The game features a snake that moves around the screen, aiming to eat food to grow longer. The player controls the snake's direction using arrow keys. The game includes a scoreboard to keep track of the score and displays a game over message when the snake collides with the boundaries or itself.

Key Features:

Object-oriented design with separate classes for Snake, Food, and Scoreboard.
Responsive controls with arrow keys for snake movement.
Random positioning of food items for added challenge.
Score tracking and game over display.
How to Play:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/sanjaynarasimhma/snake-game-python.git
Run the main script: python main.py
Use arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the snake.
Feel free to explore the code, make modifications, and enhance the game further!
